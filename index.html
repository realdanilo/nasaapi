                This telescopic close-up shows off the central regions of otherwise faint emission nebula IC 410,
                captured
                under backyard suburban skies with narrowband filters. It also features two remarkable inhabitants of
                the
                cosmic pond of gas and dust. Below and right of center are the tadpoles of IC 410. Partly obscured by
                foreground dust, the nebula itself surrounds NGC 1893, a young galactic cluster of stars. Formed in the
                interstellar cloud a mere 4 million years ago, the intensely hot, bright cluster stars energize the
                glowing
                gas. Composed of denser cooler gas and dust, the tadpoles are around 10 light-years long and are likely
                sites of ongoing star formation. Sculpted by stellar winds and radiation their heads are outlined by
                bright
                ridges of ionized gas while their tails trail away from the cluster's central young stars. IC 410 lies
                some
                10,000 light-years away, toward the nebula-rich constellation Auriga.
